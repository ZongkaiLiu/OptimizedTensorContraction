# OptimizedTensorContraction
Global search algorithms for finding optimal tensor network contraction sequences.

See our paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08063 for more details on the algorithms and results for square and random tensor networks. And let me know if you have comments or questions!


Edit fn_tensors.py to add your own tensor networks. Currently implemented: square tensor networks, random graphs.

Edit and run rn_annealing.py for Simulated Annealing.

Edit and run rn_genetic.py for the Genetic Algorithm.

Edit and run rn_greedy.py for the Greedy Algorithm.


Evaluate algorithm performance with eval_sequences.py and eval_history.py.
